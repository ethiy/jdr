abstract = {The facial performance of an individual is inherently rich in subtle defor- mation and timing details. Although these subtleties make the performance realistic and compelling, they often elude both motion capture and hand ani- mation.We present a technique for adding fine-scale details and expressive- ness to low-resolution art-directed facial performances, such as those cre- ated manually using a rig, via marker-based capture, by fitting a morphable model to a video, or through Kinect reconstruction using recent faceshift technology. We employ a high-resolution facial performance capture sys- tem to acquire a representative performance of an individual in which he or she explores the full range of facial expressiveness. From the captured data, our system extracts an expressiveness model that encodes subtle spatial and temporal deformation details specific to that particular individual. Once this model has been built, these details can be transferred to low-resolution art- directed performances. We demonstrate results on various forms of input; after our enhancement, the resulting animations exhibit the same nuances and fine spatial details as the captured performance, with optional temporal enhancement to match the dynamics of the actor. Finally, we show that our technique outperforms the current state-of-the-art in example-based facial animation.},

abstract = {We describe a new approach to fit the polyhedron describing a 3D building model to the point cloud of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). We introduce a new kinetic framework that hides to its user the combinatorial complexity of determining or maintaining the polyhedron topology, allowing the design of a simple variational optimization. This new kinetic framework allows the manipulation of a bounded polyhedron with simple faces by specifying the target plane equations of each of its faces. It proceeds by evolving continuously from the polyhedron defined by its initial topology and its initial plane equations to a polyhedron that is as topologically close as possible to the initial polyhedron but with the new plane equations. This kinetic framework handles internally the necessary topological changes that may be required to keep the faces simple and the polyhedron bounded. For each intermediate configurations where the polyhedron looses the simplicity of its faces or its boundedness, the simplest topological modification that is able to reestablish the simplicity and the boundedness is performed.},

abstract = {This paper describes an efficient method for detecting and modeling roof superstructures (detailed volumes present on roofs such as chimneys, dormer windows...) using only a Digital Elevation Map (DEM) and an initial building model without superstructures. This problem is made challenging since both detection and reconstruction should be performed simultaneously. Our proposed method is modular. The first stage (initialization stage) provides a fast and coarse detection of possible superstructures. The second stage (refine-ment stage) refines the parametric models of the coarse superstructures using either an iterative improvement scheme or a stochastic diffusion where both heuristics attempt to maximize the benefit of adding a superstructure model to the whole building model. The final stage selects the most consistent set of superstructures. Experiments as well as method comparisons show the efficiency of the proposed method.},

Our algorithm pro-vides a more complete description than existing ap-proaches by reconstructing simultaneously buildings, trees and topologically complex grounds. A major con-tribution of our work is the original way of model-ing buildings which guarantees a high generalization level while having semantized and compact represen-tations. Geometric 3D-primitives such as planes, cylin-ders, spheres or cones describe regular roof sections, and are combined with mesh-patches that represent irregu-lar roof components. The various urban components in-teract through a non-convex energy minimization prob-lem in which they are propagated under arrangement constraints over a planimetric map. Our approach is ex-perimentally validated on complex buildings and large urban scenes of millions of points, and is compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

The work reviewed in this survey stems from the following three research communities: computer graphics, computer vision, and photogrammetry and remote sensing. Our goal is to provide a survey that will help researchers to better position their own work in the context of existing solutions, and to help newcomers and practitioners in computer graphics to quickly gain an overview of this vast field. Further, we would like to bring the mentioned research communities to even more interdisciplinary work, since the reconstruction problem itself is by far not solved.},

abstract = {Quality of 3D reconstructed roads strongly depends on input data and following processing steps. Quality analysis is essential for building up a reliable reconstruction process and for a proper use of 3D data. It is therefore of interest to analyse which error sources influence the final result, and what is the sensitivity of each of these error sources. In this paper we explicitly describe quality of 3D reconstructed roads as a function of input data. These 3D roads have been reconstructed automatically by a fusion process of two input data sets: topographic map data and airborne laser data. Heights of map points are calculated by least squares plane fitting through a selection of neighbouring laser points. We determine the precision of map point heights by using error propagation techniques and properties of least squares adjustment. Map points heights have been calculated with a precision varying from a few centimetres to a few decimetres, depending on the point density and distribution of laser data. Even more important is that independent reference data showed the correctness of predicted quality by testing the actual quality against the predicted quality.},

abstract = {The paper focuses on comparing accuracies obtained with photogrammetry and laser scanning in building extraction and partly com- pares results obtained with various methods. The objective of the EuroSDR Building Extraction comparison was to evaluate the quality, accuracy, feasibility and economical aspects of semi-automatic building extraction based on photogrammetric techniques with the emphasis on commercial and/or operative systems, semi-automatic and automatic building extraction techniques based on high density laser scanner data and semi-automatic and automatic building extraction techniques based on integration of laser scan- ner data and aerial images (hybrid technique). The project consists of three test sites by Finnish Geodetic Institute (FGI), namely Senaatti, Hermanni and Espoonlahti and one test site by Institut Geographique National (IGN), namely Amiens. For each test site fol- lowing data was provided to the partners: aerial images, camera calibration and image orientation information, ground control point coordinates and jpg images of point locations (not for Amiens), laser scanner data and cadastral map vectors of selected buildings. Participants were requested to create the vectors of 3D city models. 3D-models were obtained from 11 participants. Paper confirms with experiments that laser scanning is more suitable in deriving building heights, extracting planar roof faces and ridges of the roof whereas the photogrammetry and aerial images are more suitable in building outline and length determination. CyberCity, Stuttgart and TerraScan (performed by ICC) solutions provided the highest accuracy. There seemed to be a higher variation in the quality of other models depending on test site or remotely sensed information.},
