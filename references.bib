abstract = {Three-dimensional building models are often now produced from lidar and photogrammetric data. The quality control of these models is a relevant issue both from the scientific and practical points of view. This work presents a method for the quality control of such models. The input model (3D building data) is co-registered to the verification data using a 3D surface matching method. The 3D surface matching evaluates the Euclidean distances between the verification and input data-sets. The Euclidean distances give appropriate metrics for the 3D model quality. This metric is independent of the method of data capture. The proposed method can favourably address the reference system accuracy, positional accuracy and completeness. Three practical examples of the method are provided for demonstration.},

We shortly review the system design and then we focus on the automatic components and their integration in a semiautomatic workflow for verification and update.

From the experience gained during this time we give a detailed report on the system performance in its application as well as an evaluation of the results.},

abstract = {The facial performance of an individual is inherently rich in subtle defor- mation and timing details. Although these subtleties make the performance realistic and compelling, they often elude both motion capture and hand ani- mation.We present a technique for adding fine-scale details and expressive- ness to low-resolution art-directed facial performances, such as those cre- ated manually using a rig, via marker-based capture, by fitting a morphable model to a video, or through Kinect reconstruction using recent faceshift technology. We employ a high-resolution facial performance capture sys- tem to acquire a representative performance of an individual in which he or she explores the full range of facial expressiveness. From the captured data, our system extracts an expressiveness model that encodes subtle spatial and temporal deformation details specific to that particular individual. Once this model has been built, these details can be transferred to low-resolution art- directed performances. We demonstrate results on various forms of input; after our enhancement, the resulting animations exhibit the same nuances and fine spatial details as the captured performance, with optional temporal enhancement to match the dynamics of the actor. Finally, we show that our technique outperforms the current state-of-the-art in example-based facial animation.},

We investigate in this paper to what extent can 3D city models be generated solely from 2D data without elevation measurements. We show that it is possible to predict the height of buildings from 2D data (their footprints and attributes available in volunteered geoinformation and cadastre), and then extrude their footprints to obtain 3D models suitable for a multitude of applications. The predictions have been carried out with machine learning techniques (random forests) using 10 different attributes and their combinations, which mirror different scenarios of completeness of real-world data. Some of the scenarios resulted in surprisingly good performance (given the circumstances): we have achieved a mean absolute error of 0.8m in the inferred heights, which satisfies the accuracy recommendations of CityGML for LOD1 models and the needs of several GIS analyses. We show that our method can be used in practice to generate 3D city models where there are no elevation data, and to supplement existing datasets with 3D models of newly constructed buildings to facilitate rapid update and maintenance of data. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {In the last decades, 3D city models appear to have been predominantly used for visualisation; however, today they are being increasingly employed in a number of domains and for a large range of tasks beyond visualisation. In this paper, we seek to understand and document the state of the art regarding the utilisation of 3D city models across multiple domains based on a comprehensive literature study including hundreds of research papers, technical reports and online resources. A challenge in a study such as ours is that the ways in which 3D city models are used cannot be readily listed due to fuzziness, terminological ambiguity, unclear added-value of 3D geoinformation in some instances, and absence of technical information. To address this challenge, we delineate a hierarchical terminology (spatial operations, use cases, applications), and develop a theoretical reasoning to segment and categorise the diverse uses of 3D city models. Following this framework, we provide a list of identified use cases of 3D city models (with a description of each), and their applications. Our study demonstrates that 3D city models are employed in at least 29 use cases that are a part of more than 100 applications. The classified inventory could be useful for scientists as well as stakeholders in the geospatial industry, such as companies and national mapping agencies, as it may serve as a reference document to better position their operations, design product portfolios, and to better understand the market.},

The accuracy of models is affected by many factors, but the impact of all factors leading to errors of the final models were analysed together. The accuracy of models was assessed by comparing the coordinates of characteristic points of the models and the corresponding coordinates of these points measured on real buildings. The accuracy of points measured on the real building was not affected by model errors, therefore they can be treated as error-free reference points. On site reference measurements were performed using Leica TCR407Power reflectorless total station.

abstract = {SUMMARY There is a growing interest in building modelling, especially from laser scanning data; 3D models are used in many professional applications, such as urban planning, spatial analysis, inventories of historical and cultural heritage, promotion of tourist places, and Building Information Modelling (BIM). This work presents the accuracy assessment of 3D building models created from combined airborne and terrestrial laser scanning data. The investigation was performed on both heritage and residential building models created from LiDAR point clouds acquired using terrestrial Leica ScanStation C10 and airborne Riegl LMS-Q680i scanners. Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data obtained with average point spacing of about two centimetres was the primary data used in modelling. For the modelling of building elements that were invisible from ground stations, e.g. roofs, Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data was used; it was collected with a density of about 12 pts./m2. Stitching of TLS and ALS was simplified by transforming both into the same coordinate system. Finally, textures mapping was applied, whereby textures were created from digital images taken with a camera Canon 40D. Modelling was performed semi-automatically using both the commercial software Leica Cyclone, as well as the author's software. While the accuracy of models is affected by many factors, such as scanning data accuracy, TLS and ALS data integration errors, model generalization or textures errors, it is challenging to discover the impact of all these parameters separately. In this work the accuracy assessment of 3D models is performed considering the influence of all these factors simultaneously. The accuracy of models was assessed by comparing the coordinates of characteristic points of the models and the corresponding coordinates of these points measured on the real buildings, obtained by using total station Leica TCR407Power. The field-measured points were treated as error-free reference points. In order to reduce systematic errors and offset between TLS and ALS point clouds the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm was applied for better point clouds registration. As a result of accuracy assessment, it was found that the planimetric offsets for 3D models are below 10 cm, and the vertical offsets are at the zero level. Furthermore, as a result of experiment, it was also found that the geometry of the scanning has negligible impact on final accuracy of the model.},

Hence, we aim at reliably identifying roof facets that do not comply with quality specifications. The self-diagnosis process will highlight potential incorrect facets for their inspection by a human operator. A set of calibrated aerial images enable us to collect positive or negative evidences of roof facet existence and consistency. A particular attention has been paid to the definition of a set of low-level, complementary, robust and consistent image processing measures. Four quality classes have been defined and are used to classify roof facet quality. A supervised classifier and robust decision rules are then applied to perform an effective self-diagnosis according to the traffic light paradigm. Finally, the work in progress leads to a promising quantitative and qualitative evaluation in the context of dense urban areas.},

This new kinetic framework allows the manipulation of a bounded polyhedron with simple faces by specifying the target plane equations of each of its faces. It proceeds by evolving continuously from the polyhedron defined by its initial topology and its initial plane equations to a polyhedron that is as topologically close as possible to the initial polyhedron but with the new plane equations. This kinetic framework handles internally the necessary topological changes that may be required to keep the faces simple and the polyhedron bounded. For each intermediate configurations where the polyhedron looses the simplicity of its faces or its boundedness, the simplest topological modification that is able to reestablish the simplicity and the boundedness is performed.},

The first stage (initialization stage) provides a fast and coarse detection of possible superstructures. The second stage (refine-ment stage) refines the parametric models of the coarse superstructures using either an iterative improvement scheme or a stochastic diffusion where both heuristics attempt to maximize the benefit of adding a superstructure model to the whole building model.

We aim at massive production of 3D urban models and present thus an algorithm, that is an adaptation of a more general and semi-automatic strategy to an operational context where robustness is essential. We present two approaches relying on two different techniques for non vertical planes extraction using constraints inferred by cadastral limits. The first one consists in inferring planar primitives by estimating only two parameters for each building : the height of gutter and the slope of roofs. The other idea is to extract planar primitives directly from the cadastral limits and from the DEM, using a robust RANSAC estimation algorithm. The results of an evaluation carried out on 620 buildings on a dense urban centre are promising and enables to compare both approaches.},

Quality analysis is essential for building up a reliable reconstruction process and for a proper use of 3D data. It is therefore of interest to analyse which error sources influence the final result, and what is the sensitivity of each of these error sources. In this paper we explicitly describe quality of 3D reconstructed roads as a function of input data. These 3D roads have been reconstructed automatically by a fusion process of two input data sets: topographic map data and airborne laser data. Heights of map points are calculated by least squares plane fitting through a selection of neighbouring laser points. We determine the precision of map point heights by using error propagation techniques and properties of least squares adjustment. Map points heights have been calculated with a precision varying from a few centimetres to a few decimetres, depending on the point density and distribution of laser data. Even more important is that independent reference data showed the correctness of predicted quality by testing the actual quality against the predicted quality.},

abstract = {With the increasing point densities provided by airborne laser scanner (ALS) data the requirements on derived products also increase. One major application of ALS data is to provide input for 3D city models. Modeling of roof faces, (3D) road and terrain surfaces can partially be done in an automated manner, although many such approaches are still in a development stage. Problems in automatic building reconstruction lie in the dynamic area between assumptions and reality. Not every object in the data appears as the algorithm expects. Challenges are to detect areas that cannot be reconstructed automatically. This paper describes our contribution to the field of building reconstruction by proposing a target based graph matching approach that can handle both complete and incomplete laser data. Match results describe which target objects appear topologically in the data. Complete match results can be reconstructed in an automated manner. Quality parameters store information on how the model fits to the input data and which data has not been used. Areas where laser data only partly matches with target objects are detected automatically. Four datasets are analyzed in order to describe the quality of the automatically reconstructed roofs, and to point out the reasons why segments are left out from the automatic reconstruction. The reasons why these areas are left out include lack of data information and limitations of our initial target objects. Potential improvement to our approach is to include likelihood functions to the existence of topological relations.},

abstract = {The development of tools for the generation of 3D city models started almost two decades ago. From the beginning, fully automatic reconstruction systems were envisioned to fulfil the need for efficient data collection. However, research on automatic city modelling is still a very active area. The paper will review a number of current approaches in order to comprehensively elaborate the state of the art of reconstruction methods and their respective principles. Originally, automatic city modelling only aimed at polyhedral building objects, which mainly reflects the respective roof shapes and building footprints. For this purpose, airborne images or laser scans are used. In addition to these developments, the paper will also review current approaches for the generation of more detailed facade geometries from terrestrial data collection. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {The paper focuses on comparing accuracies obtained with photogrammetry and laser scanning in building extraction and partly com- pares results obtained with various methods. The objective of the EuroSDR Building Extraction comparison was to evaluate the quality, accuracy, feasibility and economical aspects of semi-automatic building extraction based on photogrammetric techniques with the emphasis on commercial and/or operative systems, semi-automatic and automatic building extraction techniques based on high density laser scanner data and semi-automatic and automatic building extraction techniques based on integration of laser scan- ner data and aerial images (hybrid technique). The project consists of three test sites by Finnish Geodetic Institute (FGI), namely Senaatti, Hermanni and Espoonlahti and one test site by Institut Geographique National (IGN), namely Amiens. For each test site fol- lowing data was provided to the partners: aerial images, camera calibration and image orientation information, ground control point coordinates and jpg images of point locations (not for Amiens), laser scanner data and cadastral map vectors of selected buildings. Participants were requested to create the vectors of 3D city models. 3D-models were obtained from 11 participants. Paper confirms with experiments that laser scanning is more suitable in deriving building heights, extracting planar roof faces and ridges of the roof whereas the photogrammetry and aerial images are more suitable in building outline and length determination. CyberCity, Stuttgart and TerraScan (performed by ICC) solutions provided the highest accuracy. There seemed to be a higher variation in the quality of other models depending on test site or remotely sensed information.},

abstract = {We present a new approach for building reconstruction from a single Digital Surface Model (DSM). It treats buildings as an assemblage of simple urban structures extracted from a library of 3D parametric blocks (like a LEGO set). First, the 2D-supports of the urban structures are extracted either interactively or automatically. Then, 3D-blocks are placed on the 2D-supports using a Gibbs model which controls both the block assemblage and the fitting to data. A Bayesian decision finds the optimal configuration of 3D-blocks using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler associated with original proposition kernels. This method has been validated on multiple data set in a wide-resolution interval such as 0.7 m satellite and 0.1 m aerial DSMs, and provides 3D representations on complex buildings and dense urban areas with various levels of detail.},

abstract = {Terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) data plays an important role in 3D modelling of urban scenes. Much research is carried out in the fields of pre-processing, segmentation and geometric reconstruction of laser data of building fa{\c{C}}ades. However, the quality of 3D models obtained from this data is rarely assessed. This paper proposes a qualitative and quantitative assessment approach to evaluate the quality of 3D models of fa{\c{C}}ades constructed with TLS data. Only segmentation and reconstruction operations are considered in this paper, because they cover the main steps in the 3D modelling process. Since every processing step produces an intermediate result, each one must be analysed and compared with an appropriate reference model. A new approach has been conceived to evaluate the precision of the segmentation results. It is based on the calculation of Boolean operators enabling the comparison of planar clusters produced by the segmentation. To evaluate the vector models resulting from the reconstruction step, a method based on quality indices is proposed. It is adapted not only for precision but also for accuracy calculations. The results show that the quality assessment approach is coherent and, moreover, easy to apply. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

As input data, a DSM at 1m resolution derived from a GeoEye-1 stereo-pair, a DSM from an aerial block at 50 cm GSD and a LiDAR-based DSM at 1m resolution are used. The geometric buildings produced with each dataset are evaluated with respect to some ground-truth measurements but also compared between them. Problems such as the quality of the input DSM , the accuracy of the necessary vector datasets containing the building footprints, the flexibility of the approaches and the potentialities of each dataset will be discussed. As reconstruction of the building models is largely influenced by the quality of the building footprints, which may be out-of-date or slightly shifted with respect to the employed DSM s/DTM s, an in-house method is being developed to derive them starting from the produced DSM s.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen significant improvements in the performance of automatic cartographic feature extraction (CFE) systems. Early systems, painstakingly tweaked to work in a very limited fashion on small images, have given way to sys-tems which produce credible results in situations representative of production environments. While no existing automatic system is yet ready for incorporation into a production environment, significant strides have been made toward this goal. Semi-automated systems, with significant man-in-the-loop capabilities, continue to be developed by photogrammetric workstation vendors. However, a fundamental requirement for system development, and an absolute prerequisite for production applications, is the rigorous evaluation of automated system performance. Indeed, without meaningful evaluation, we can hardly be said to be doing science. Rigorous evaluation requires the definition of a set of metrics, relevant to user requirements and meaningful in terms of expected system performance. These metrics must be generated across common, well-documented datasets which are representative of production sources and scenes. To provide concrete examples of system evaluation techniques, this paper describes work in the Digital Mapping Lab-oratory on the evaluation of automated cartographic feature extraction systems. Activities include the definition and publication of metrics for several types of feature extraction systems, the generation and distribution of several large test data sets, and extensive evaluations on our CFE systems. The paper concludes with a discussion of future activities and directions in system evaluation.},

However, even state-of-the-art algorithms have intrinsic limits and many errors exist in 3D reconstructions, requiring expensive manual corrections. A new approach is proposed in this paper for the automatic diagnosis of 3D building databases in urban areas. A novel error taxonomy which allows a subsequent high-level diagnosis is first proposed. Then, relevant raster and vector features are extracted from very high resolution multi-view images and Digital Surface Models so as that to retrieve such errors. In a supervised way, a set of functions is presented in order to take high-level decisions from these low-level features. Experiments on 355 buildings in an European dense city center with 10 cm airborne images demonstrate the high accuracy on error detection and show promising results.},

abstract = {Modern satellites tag their images with geolocation information using GPS and star tracking systems. Depending on the quality of the geopositioning equipment, errors may range from a few meters to tens of meters on the ground. At the current state of art, there is no established method to automatically correct these errors limiting the large-scale joint utilization of cross-platform satellite images. In this paper, an automatic geolocation correction framework that corrects images from multiple satellites simultaneously is presented. As a result of the proposed correction process, all the images are effectively registered to the same absolute geodetic coordinate frame. The usability and the quality of the correction framework are demonstrated through a 3-D surface reconstruction application. The 3-D surface models given by original satellite geopositioning metadata, and the corrected metadata, are compared. The quality difference is measured through an entropy-based metric applied to the orthographic height maps given by the 3-D surface models. Measuring the absolute accuracy of the framework is harder due to lack of publicly available high-precision ground surveys. However, the geolocation of images of exemplar satellites from different parts of the globe are corrected, and the road networks given by OpenStreetMap are projected onto the images using original and corrected metadata to demonstrate the improved quality of alignment.},

Well known quality factors have been applied for assessing roofs and fa{\c{c}}ades separately. A projection into 2D makes sense in this case, because currently, 3D models or point clouds of fa{\c{c}}ades are often projected into 2D for generating 2D fa{\c{c}}ade maps, as required in the building trades. For assessing roofs in 3D, error maps have been suggested especially for analysing the spatial distribution of plane adjustment errors which might affect the final reconstructed 3D model. For assessing 3D building vector models as one object, first experiments based on volumetric quality factors are presented. This approach is based on ratios inspired from quality factors that have already proven themselves in the literature for comparing surface areas. The volumes considered here are computed on vector models (faceted solids) and not voxels. Further investigations are necessary on the one hand, for testing the sensitivity of these factors. On the other hand, the approach must be completed by criteria allowing the detection of shape differences, independently of the building volume.},

abstract = {KEY WORDS: Building, Reconstruction, Modeling, Aerial, Image, Automation, Systems, Photogrammetry. A novel system for automatic building reconstruction from multiple aerial images is presented. Compared to previous works, this approach uses a very generic modeling of buildings as polyhedral shapes with no overhang, in which external knowledge is introduced through constraints on primitives. Using planes as base primitives, the algorithm builds up an arrangement of planes from which a 3D graph of facets is deduced. In a so-called compatibility graph where the nodes are the initial facets of the 3D graph and edges between two nodes state that both facets belong to at least one common hypothesis of building, it is shown that maximal cliques supply all the hypotheses of buildings that can be deduced from the arrangement of planes. Among these hypotheses the choice is done through a bayesian formulation that balance data adequacy and caricature needs. Results are provided on real images and show the validity of the approach that remains very generic on the contrary to model-based methods while bringing external architectural information through geometric constraints, which generally lacks in data-driven algorithms.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method to detect and construct a 3D geometric model of an urban area with complex buildings using aerial LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data. The LIDAR data collected from a nadir direction is a point cloud containing surface samples of not only the building roofs and terrain but also undesirable clutter from trees, cars, etc. The main contribution of this work is the automatic recognition and estimation of simple parametric shapes that can be combined to model very complex buildings from aerial LIDAR data. The main components of the detection and modeling algorithms are (i) Segmentation of roof and terrain points. (ii) Roof topology Inference. We introduce the concept of a roof-topology graph to represent the relationships between the various planar patches of a complex roof structure. (iii) Parametric roof composition. Simple parametric roof shapes that can be combined to create a complex roof structure of a building are recognized by searching for sub-graphs in its roof-topology graph. (iv) Terrain Modeling. The terrain is identified and modeled as a triangulated mesh. Finally, we provide experimental results that demonstrate the validity of our approach for rapid and automatic building detection and geometric modeling with real LIDAR data. We are able to model cities and other urban areas at the rate of about 10 minutes per sq. mile on a low-end PC.},

abstract = {Sustainable use and management of energy resources is a challenging task for growing urban population. Especially, an urban environment in temperate continental climate consumes high energy resources for their space heating and domestic hot water demands. Assessment of thermal energy requirements for future energy demands is fundamental to sustainable urban environment. Thermal energy demand can be simulated using physical and empirical laws from building physics domain. Physical laws compute thermal energy consumption based on heterogeneous datasets from various data sources. These datasets may include information from cadastre, building registers, inhabitant census, 3D building models, ground surveys and meteorological databases. Furthermore, depending upon availability, accessibility and level of detail, specific simulation methods are usually employed for evaluation of energy consumption at different spatial scales. This paper attempts to identify input data parameters which could facilitate validation and calibration of thermal energy demand based on input data sensitivity using simulation methods.},

@article{Wong2016,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Three-dimensional geospatial information is being increasingly used in a range of tasks beyond visualisation. 3D datasets, however, are often being produced without exact specifications and at mixed levels of geometric complexity. This leads to variations within the models' geometric and semantic complexity as well as the degree of deviation from the corresponding real world objects. Existing descriptors and measures of 3D data such as CityGML's level of detail are perhaps only partially sufficient in communicating data quality and fitness-for-purpose. This study investigates whether alternative, automated, geometry-based metrics describing the variation of complexity within 3D datasets could provide additional relevant information as part of a process of fitness-for-purpose evaluation. The metrics include: mean vertex/edge/face counts per building; vertex/face ratio; minimum 2D footprint area and; minimum feature length. Each metric was tested on six 3D city models from international locations. The results show that geometry-based metrics can provide additional information on 3D city models as part of fitness-for-purpose evaluations. The metrics, while they cannot be used in isolation, may provide a complement to enhance existing data descriptors if backed up with local knowledge, where possible.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
